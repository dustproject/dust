# DUST

## Program the world

DUST is our serious attempt at seeding an [autonomous world](https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds).

DUST is deeply programmable.
Instead of separate mods or servers, you deploy your code into the single shard of DUST, where it becomes part of everyones reality and outlives you.

Command machines, turn chests into shops and doors into toll gates. Build currencies, reputation systens, governments and more.

On the following pages you'll learn about:

- [Programs](/programs): Smart contracts that define the rules of your onchain entities
- [Apps](/apps): Custom user interfaces that integrate with the native client
- [Examples](/examples/swap-chest): Practical end-to-end use cases
