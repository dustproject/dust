Bots are a great way to automate tedious tasks in DUST. There are many ways you can run a bot:

#### a) using the browser console in the DUST client

- Easier to get started but limited in functionality

#### b) external scripts

- You can do whatever you like but requires more setup

#### c) Yeomen Command

- Yeomen is a third party automation tool: [https://command.yeomen.ai/apps?q=tags%3ADust](https://command.yeomen.ai/apps?q=tags%3ADust).
