<summary>I moved via a bot, but its not updating in the client</summary>

The client uses the position in the client as the source of truth. However, after
30 seconds of inactivity, it will start using the position onchain and on new updates,
teleport the player in the client there. If you've recently moved in the client,
you'll need to wait 30 seconds before trying.
